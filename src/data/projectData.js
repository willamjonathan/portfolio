    <p>Teaching Team (TT) is a university-level platform built to manage tutor and lab assistant recruitment. It includes three main user roles: Candidates (who apply for roles), Lecturers (who view applicants for their courses), and Admins (who manage courses, assignments, and reports via a separate dashboard). The system is fully integrated with Cloud MySQL, uses REST and GraphQL APIs, and features a clean, functional UI built with TypeScript.</p>

    <p>The Automated Waste Sorting Bin for Metal and Non-metal Dry Waste that we are making is
    specifically designed for separating metal and non-metal dry waste. We have incorporated
    the use of several sensors. One of them is the inductive proximity sensors for
    recognizing and sorting metal and non-metal items. Additionally, we have included an
    ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of objects and servo motors to facilitate the
    rotation of trash compartments and coin dispensing.</p>
    <p>To support such machinery, designing and creating a shell case for the hardware is also necessary,
    to which we decided to use infra boards. Metal wiring will also be added to some parts of the casing
    for better functionality, such as for the coin dispenser and rotational trash sorting apparatus.</p>

    HIV is a virus that has become a world problem as its cure has not yet been found. The
    HIV can go to an undetected state if only treated by ART or antiretroviral therapy.
    Hence, knowing the danger that HIV brings, we are here to analyze the effect of
    Antiretroviral therapy or ART to HIV using several of its categories between 75
    countries. We are planning to use machine learning techniques that are available.
    We will use both supervised and unsupervised learning, then we will do evaluation by using
    accuracy testing, recall, precision, and F1-score. After that, we will conclude which
    machine learning is the best to apply to our dataset.</p>

    <p>MUSE is a program designed with 2 main features, an image reconstructor and a painter
    identifier. It is designed to assist art enthusiasts and general users in decomposing
    pictures and reconstruct it step by step and assisting people in identifying the painter
    behind a famous painting. From identifying the painter behind a painting, users can
    explore the artist's works for their artstyles, fulfill their curiosity, or just to
    appreciate them.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the image reconstructor allows users to see the decomposition
    to full reconstruction process, done by a genetic algorithm through a natural selection
    of the fittest generation, which can aid in their art journey. The image reconstructor
    utilizes the DEAP framework for genetic algorithm while the painter identifier uses a
    Tensorflow Keras (CNN) based model for the predictions.</p>
